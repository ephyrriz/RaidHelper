To-Do:

RaidHelper:
- Batch process for raiders teleport.
- Cache collection of players and raiders of each raid, delete after some time to avoid constant references to them.
- Delete loggers.
- Check why the height is being used inconsistently.
- Add a message when you teleport a raid
- Check how we get raiders and teleport them between partial and full teleport.
